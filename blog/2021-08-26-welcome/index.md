Eaxmple for blog post with tabs for different platform.

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

<!-- truncate -->

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Docusaurus Plushie](./docusaurus-plushie-banner.jpg)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config.
