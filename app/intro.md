# Intro

The team, strategy and mission.

## Our mission

Imagine you're building a big castle out of colourful building blocks. Each block has its own shape, size, and color. Now, think about making sure all the parts of your castle look and fit together nicely. That's where a design system comes in!

A design system is like a special set of instructions for making things, just like how you follow a recipe to make your favourite cookies. In this case, the "things" are websites, apps, or even documents. It helps people who are building these things to choose the right colors, fonts, and shapes so that everything looks consistent and works well together.

Just like your castle blocks all fit together because they're made from the same set of rules, a design system makes sure that all the different parts of a website or app look and work nicely together. This makes it easier for everyone to understand and use the website or app, just like how you can easily build and play with your castle because all the blocks work together perfectly!

And what is a component within a design system?
Button component explained
In a design system, a button is a common element used in websites and apps to perform actions when clicked. But a button isn't just a simple shape with a single color. It's made up of different parts, and each part can be thought of as a token. Here's how:

- **Background Color Token**: The color of the button's background. Designers choose from predefined colors to maintain consistency across the design.

- **Text Color Token**: The color of the text on the button. It needs to contrast well with the background color for readability.

- **Corner Radius Token**: Defines how much the corners of the button should be rounded, creating the familiar rounded-corner look.

- **Padding Token**: The space between the button's content and its edges. Different buttons may have different padding, but all follow predefined values.

- **Font Token**: The typeface used for the button's text. Design systems typically offer a selection of fonts to choose from.

- **Shadow Token**: Defines the appearance of the shadow beneath the button, creating a visual "pop" effect.

So, when designers and developers want to create a button using the design system, they can pick the specific values for each of these tokens to make sure the button looks consistent with the rest of the design. This makes it easier to create buttons that all fit the same style and work well together in websites and apps.

## What are we launching?

A design system. Which is a collection of reusable components with clearly defined standards for use. These components combine pattern libraries, colors, and fonts with standardised design principles to help us achieve consistent visual design at scale. In short it makes it easier for us as a tech company to deliver features faster, more consistently and with higher quality to end-users.

A design system is a constantly evolving product; there is no final destination. A design system grows and changes with the organisation, e.g the design system would need to be updated if the company goes through a rebranding process, which can be both big and small. Below you can see how Spotifyâ€™s design has changed over the course of time. This is a great example of constant change and digital products are under constant development both from inside the organisation but also from outside factors such as new hardware, new behaviours etc.

## Why are we launching a design system?

A design system allows us to build a consistent user experience, deploy features more quickly, make rebranding changes more efficiently and free-up time to address challenging UX issues. Basically in the long run a design system will be more cost effective.

## Why is it good for EPG to have a design system?

The below list are some examples of how EPG will benefit from having a design system. The different aspects are of course intertwined

- Reduced costs and scalability: Having everything in one place reduces the amount of work done by multiple teams especially when it comes to re-skin the whole app. Reduced design and development time has the potential to save a lot of money in the long run.

- Quality: A design system makes design decisions reusable, allowing product teams to build products faster without sacrificing quality.

- Productivity: As we will have a single source of truth, productivity will improve.

- Consistency: Having a set of reusable elements together with documentation eliminates the need for the front-end team to make design decisions for every single new feature. Which will allow end-users a better experience.

How will we know what users of the design system wants and needs?
We will collaborate closely with the front-end teams. Especially the teams that are customer facing.

## What is the timeline?

In close collaboration with the customer facing feature teams we will try to prioritise what needs to be done and start small and learn fast.

Since we are starting from scratch there is a long road ahead of us. Let us present an analogy where we set out to produce cars. In order for us to produce cars we first need a factory where we can do so. So first we need to find workers that can build a factory. Then we need to construct the car, how should the engine work, what seats should it have, how should the steering wheel look. Bit by bit we set the details of the factory together in order to create a production line and deliver cars to the customers. The takeaway here is that since we are building from scratch there are many foundational things that we are working on as well and not only the components, tokens and icons etc.

## How should teams build things while waiting for the design system?

The purpose of the design system is to enable teams to deliver faster with consistent and coherent design to our end users. The consistency and coherence will continuously develop as the design system evolves and matures.

As the design system will be released bit by bit teams can start using it. However, since we are starting from scratch, many components, tokens and patterns will come later. Meanwhile teams should continue delivering and developing products based on the design guideline documentations available.

## What does a design system not solve for?

A design system will not provide finished designs for features in the app/web.

The design system will not provide components that are one offs, i.e components that are used only in one place. An example of this is the wheel screen. The design system will focus on scalability, hence providing components and patterns that exist in multiple places.

External technical limitations and evolution
As operating systems evolve and hardware gets introduced the design system and product needs to adapt to adhere to the new situation. An example is how wearables got introduced to the market, this has changed behaviours and expectations on how apps and services work in relation to that. Another example is in-car entertainment system which have changed the behaviour of drivers and their expectations, for example being able to connect your device to listen to your streaming service or connecting your maps app instead of having a separate GPS system.

So what does this matter for a design system? The technical limitations and evolution opens opportunities for products to continuously develop and adapt to the new circumstances and expectations.
